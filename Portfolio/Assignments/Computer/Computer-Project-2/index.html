    <h1>Block Diagram Of Computer:</h1>
    
    <p id="p_1">
            The Computer system consists of mainly three types that are 
        <central processing unit (CPU),  Input Devices,> and Output Devices.
        The Central processing unit (CPU) again 
            consist of ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and Control Unit.

    <h2>Funtions Of Each Part:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Main Memory:</h3>
        </li>
        <p> 
            The Main Memory is one of the most important
            parts of computer system.The main memory in a computer is called Random Access Memory. 
            It is also known as RAM. There are two types of 
            Main Memory,these are  Primary and Secondary
            Memory.
        </p>   
             <Li>
                 <H3>Auxiliary Storage:</H3>
             </Li> 
        <p> 
            Auxiliary storage is the second name of 
            External storage Or Secondary storage.
            Auxiliary storage is the permanent memory and it 
            lies outside the  It is used to store 
            large quantities of data for longer period of time.
            It is  non volatile.
       </p>  
       
       <li> <h3>Arthimetic Logic Unit(ALU):</h3> </li>

        <p> 
            An arithmetic logic unit is a combinational digital 
            electronic circuit   that performs arithmetic and 
            logics.It represents the fundamental building block
            of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.
             Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.
          </p>
         
        <li>
              <h3>Control Unit:</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            All the commands and instructions are being
            controlled  by the Contorl unit. It 
            tells the computer's memory, arithmetic and 
            logic unit and input and output devices how
             to respond to the instructions that have 
             been sent to the processor.It controls 
             all devices of computer system.
