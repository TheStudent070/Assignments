    <h1 id="Twitter">Dearness The Rising Costs Of Things:</h1>

    <h2 id="Google">Introduction:</h2>
    <p> The problem of rising prices is the greatest economics 
        problem in our country today.Dearness is cutting the
        throat of millions today because millions of people
        do not get food and drink of one time.All days hardwork
        does not promise them sufficent food and drink.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Google">Structure:</h2>
    <p> Prices have been doubled in the last few several years.
       As ill luck would have it,the things of daily use are also
       beyond the reach of the common people.Things are also going beyond 
       the reach of commom people in each passing day.The inflation rate 
       of Pakistan in 2017 was 4.15% then it got low to 3.93% in 2018
       next, suddenly the inflation rate in 2019 hit to 6.74% and now 
       the inflation rate in Pakistan has crossed all the limits in the 
       history and is 11.12%.
        </p>

       <h2 id="Google">Facts and Figures:</h2> 
       <p>
          We all now that we are passing through the worst days 
          of our history we are passing with this pandemic.Covid-19
           has effected the economy of many countries such as:
          America,China,UK(United Kingdom)e.t.c In U.S.A 14.7 percent 
          people have been fired up from their jobs just two months 
          ago the unimployment rate in America was 3.5%.The unimployment
          rate in Pakisatn has reached to 28 percent
       </p>
    
      <h2 id="Google">Whats our responsibility in Covid 19:</h2>
       <p>Great responsibility lies on our shoulders in this
           situation where no one can touch his/her dear one's
           where many people have been fired up from their jobs.
           So now its our responsibility to take care of every person 
           means by providing food to the poor people,by providing 
           facilities to our Muslim brothers,by acting upon the orders
           of government and by keeping distance from every one.These
           above responsibilities are for every person and if we will
           act upon the above advices then no one will sleep hungry InsahaAllah.
      </p>

      <h2 id="Google">Conclusion:</h2>
      <P>Paksitan is our beloved country and its poor citizens are
          our responsibility.Government is trying to do as much as
          it can but again government can not provide food to 22 million people
          So, we have to participate with our government.If we will
          participate then Pakistan will be a progressed and prosperous country.
          We have to cut the roots of Dearness from our country.InshaAllah!</P>
