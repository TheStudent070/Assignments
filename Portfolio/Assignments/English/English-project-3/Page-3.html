    <h2>Golden Era In The History Of Pakistan:</h2>
    <p>
        The <b class="B_1">golden era</b> in Pakistan's History
        started from <b class="B_1">1960s</b>.This was the era,when 
        we were the pioneers of the developing world. <b class="B_1">PIA</b>
        and other companies were training the big organizations like
        <b class="B_1">Emirates Airlines</b> and the historic visit 
        of <b class="B_1"> President Ayub Khan to U.S.A is the biggest
         example of our glory at that time.</b>    
         Our agriculture sector 
        was producing the biggest exports.Pakistan was exporting  its
        goods to the entire world.We were called a developed country
        at that time.This all was because,we were the true Muslims at that
        time and we knew our ideology that why we got Pakistan.As 
        Allama Iqbal said;
