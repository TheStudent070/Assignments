    <h2>Sacrifices Of Our Ancestors:</h2>

    </p>  

    <h2>Creation Of Pakistan:</h2>
       
           <p>
                Pakistan got created by the sacrifices and hardwork 
                of our great leaders <b class="B_1" >(Quaid-E-Azam,Allama Iqbal
                ,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan,Liaqat Ali Khan,Muhtarma Fatima Ali Jinnah and
                many others)</b>.These all leaders sacrified their day in and day out
                to achieve a separate homeland for the Muslims of sub-continent.
                Firstly,they organized the people under the one platform 
                which was of <b class="B_1"> Muslim League.</b>The people also obeied
                their leaders.When all the leaders and the Muslims were organied 
                then they started the struggle in <b class="B_1"> 1940</b>and in the short
                time period of seven years <b class="B_1"> Pakistan</b> was achieved.
                It got created by the struggle of every person in <b class="B_1">Pakistan
                 Movememt</b> because a single person can do nothing if the people are united and
                 organized than they can achieve a big cause. 
            </p>

      <h2>Golden Era In The History Of Pakistan:</h2>
      <p>
          The <b class="B_1">golden era</b> in Pakistan's History
          started from <b class="B_1">1960s</b>.This was the era,when 
          we were the pioneers of the developing world. <b class="B_1">PIA</b>
          and other companies were training the big organizations like
          <b class="B_1">Emirates Airlines</b> and the historic visit 
          of <b class="B_1"> President Ayub Khan to U.S.A is the biggest
           example of our glory at that time.</b>    
           Our agriculture sector 
          was producing the biggest exports.Pakistan was exporting  its
          goods to the entire world.We were called a developed country
          at that time.This all was because,we were the true Muslims at that
          time and we knew our ideology that why we got Pakistan.As 
          Allama Iqbal said;           
      </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

        <p>
            Paksitan is our beloved country.We love our country by
            heart and soul but unfortunately,now our condition is not
            good because we have forgotton our ideology for which
            approxiamately <b class="B_1">fifty Lac</b> people sacrificed
            their lives because they realized that it is impossible for 
            the Muslims of sub-continent to live with Hindus and how can we
            forget the famous statement of Quaid-E-Azam about Hindus that
            <b class="B_1">"The Hindu is incorrigible"</b>
