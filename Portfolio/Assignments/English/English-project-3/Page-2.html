    <h2>Creation Of Pakistan:</h2>
       
    <p>
         Pakistan got created by the sacrifices and hardwork 
         of our great leaders <b class="B_1" >(Quaid-E-Azam,Allama Iqbal
         ,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan,Liaqat Ali Khan,Muhtarma Fatima Ali Jinnah and
         many others)</b>.These all leaders sacrified their day in and day out
         to achieve a separate homeland for the Muslims of sub-continent.
         Firstly,they organized the people under the one platform 
         which was of <b class="B_1"> Muslim League.</b>The people also obeied
         their leaders.When all the leaders and the Muslims were organied 
         then they started the struggle in <b class="B_1"> 1940</b>and in the short
         time period of seven years <b class="B_1"> Pakistan</b> was achieved.
         It got created by the struggle of every person in <b class="B_1">Pakistan
          Movememt</b> because a single person can do nothing if the people are united and
          organized than they can achieve a big cause.
