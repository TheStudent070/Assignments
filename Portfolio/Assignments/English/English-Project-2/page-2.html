    <h2>Background of Eid-ul-Adha:</h2>
    <p>The backgoround of <b class="Bold"> Eid-ul-Adha</b> is the
    great sacrifice of <b class="Bold">Hazrat Ismail (A.S).</b>Many years ago,
    <b class="Bold">Hazrat Ibrahim (A.S)</b> saw dream in which <b>Allah(S.A.W) </b>
 asked him to sacrifice his only son <b class="Bold">(Prophet Ismail)</b> who was
 just 13 
 years old at that time.
  </p>
  <h2>Reply Of Prophet Ismail(A.S) To His Father:</h2>
  <p>Prophet Ibrahim(A.S) conveyed the dream to his son.
  Hazrat Ismail(A.S) answered bravily <b class="Bold">"Oh my father do as you 
  are commanded I will remain patient" </b> Allah (S.A.W) was Pleased 
  with both father and son's loyality,obedience,courage and respect.
Allah(S.A.W)sent a sheep instead of Prophet Ismail and that's why
Eid-Ul-Adha is celebrated.</p>
